\subsection{Subsystem Concept Definition: Planning}
\textit{-	Refer to Kossiakoff, Chapter 9\\
-	Provide a single-figure subsystem functional diagram\\
\hspace*{2em}o	Extend on the practical guide diagram with more details, unique to your design.\\
\hspace*{2em}o	Include direction and nature of all internal and external interactions, including those with other subsystems and those with the outside world.\\
-	Provide a single-figure subsystem architecture diagram\\
\hspace*{2em}o	Extend on the practical guide diagram with more details, unique to your design.\\
\hspace*{2em}o	Draw to component / software function level \\
\hspace*{2em}o	Include direction and nature of all internal and external interactions, both to the external world and to other subsystems \\
\hspace*{2em}o	Indicate clearly which components are designed and which components are bought off-the-shelf. \\
\textbf{-	This must be more detailed than the diagrams in the practical guide; copies of the practical guide figures will receive 0 marks. }}
