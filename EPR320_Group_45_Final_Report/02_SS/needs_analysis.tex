\subsection{Subsystem Needs Analysis}


% Write your subsystem needs analysis here
A crucial element of the autonomous vehicle known as MARV is the SS(sensor subsystem). In this context, one that is capable of navigating a maze for which the only guides to the end are coloured lines, representing different obstacles on a PVC mat.

The MARV will need to identify the obstacles by interpreting the colour of the lines on the maze. This means that SS will need some form of colour detection.

To prevent the disturbance of changing ambient light, SS will need to minimise its influence when performing colour detection.

The MARV will need to keep track of the MARVs orientation inside the maze. This means that SS will need to calculate the angle of incidence when crossing the lines. 

SS will need to integrate with the full system with minimal change in functionality and operation.

For SS to integrate with the full system, SS will need to use the communication protocol provided, which will enable seamless communication with other subsystems.

Though SS is a subsystem, it needs to work independently as well for testing during development. This means that SS will need its own power supply. 

The afore mentioned needs for SS are shown in a context diagram to better illustrate the subsystem's place in the system as a whole.
