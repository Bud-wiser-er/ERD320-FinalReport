\subsection{Subsystem Needs Analysis}

\noindent
The design and construction of a Microcontroller-based Autonomous Robotic Vehicle (MARV) capable of navigating through a maze using predetermined navigation rules requires the development of multiple interacting subsystems. These subsystems must communicate effectively to function as a cohesive unit and achieve the overall task. In particular, a Sensor Subsystem (SS) is required to detect and measure the MARV’s surrounding environment, a State-and-Navigation Control (SNC) subsystem is needed to interpret sensor data and execute decision-making protocols, and a Motor Driver and Power Supply (MDPS) subsystem must supply power to all components and control the MARV’s movement. Together, these three subsystems fulfil the essential functions of detection, processing, and actuation.\\

\noindent
Focusing on the MDPS subsystem, there is a need to control the MARV’s speed and direction based on commands received from the State-and-Navigation Control (SNC) subsystem, and it must measure the MARV’s speed, distance travelled, and rotational displacement. The MDPS must also supply power to all subsystems to enable operation independent of external power sources. In addition, the MDPS must be able to receive and transmit information to and from the SNC and SS.
